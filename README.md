# angular-wasm
This is a simple projet where I want to show how WebAssembly could be used in Angular 2+. The project includes some components and services to help this integration.

## Build

To build the library, run the following in the root folder:
```
npm install
npm run build
npm pack
```

## Demo

To build the demo, run the following in the `demo` folder:
```
npm install
npm start
```

This will start a server at `http://localhost:4200` where you can see the demo.
