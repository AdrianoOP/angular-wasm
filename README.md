# angular-wasm
A simple project showing how WebAssembly could be used in Angular 2+. The project includes some components and services to help this integration.

## Prerequisites

You need to download and install Emscripten as described on the official [website](http://kripken.github.io/emscripten-site/docs/getting_started/downloads.html).

## Build

To build the library, run the following in the root folder:
```
npm install
npm start
```

This will start a server at `http://localhost:4200` where you can see the demo.
