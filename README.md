# angular-wasm
This is a simple projet where I want to show how WebAssembly could be used in Angular 2+. The project includes some components and services to help this integration.

## Build

To build the library, run the following in the root folder:
```
npm install
npm run build
```

## Demo

To build the demo, run the following in the `demo` folder:
```
npm install
npm run build
```

Then to see the demo, do:
```
npm run start
```
